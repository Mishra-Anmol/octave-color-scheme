# Octave Color Scheme

Alternative color themes for [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
 
Currently only a half-baked dark theme to blend with my workspace.

## How to use

* Backup your config (mine was located at %HOME/.config/octave/qt-settings
* Edit qt-settings and manually replace the same prefix lines in the [Scintilla] and [Terminal] sections with the contents of this repo 

## ToDo 

* Web based tool to edit scheme
 - Or make it a built-in feature that supports normalized scheme filetypes
